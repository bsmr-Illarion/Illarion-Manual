\section{Roleplaying}
There are numerous opinions and lessons describing role play. This one doesn’t claim to be exhaustive nor sole validity. Always remember:
\begin{center}
\emph{You play a role. You are not the character you are playing.}
\end{center}
The character you are playing should have the following characteristics: 
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{ l p{12.5cm}}
Background story & You don’t need a novel but some basic points should be 
defined. The empty parts in your story will fill in with time by 
itself. \\
(Dis-) Advantages & Nobody is only a bright hero and nobody loses all the 
time. Your character should have some positive as well as some negative attributes. \\
Goals & Your character should have a dream, something he or she 
wants to achieve desperately. \\
Phobia & There should be something he or she hates or fears. \\
Distinctiveness & Your character should have a quirk. It should be some distinctive feature, e.g. that could be a tiny voice, a 
special greeting or a preference for yellow hats.
