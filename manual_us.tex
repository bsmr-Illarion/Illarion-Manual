\section{Roleplaying}

There are numerous opinions and lessons describing role play. This one doesn’t claim to be exhaustive nor sole validity. Always remember:
\begin{center}
\fbox{
\emph{You play a role. You are not the character you are playing.}}
\end{center}

The character you are playing should have the following characteristics: 
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{ l p{12.5cm}}
Background story & You don’t need a novel but some basic points should be 
defined. The empty parts in your story will fill in with time by 
itself. \\
(Dis-) Advantages & Nobody is only a bright hero and nobody loses all the 
time. Your character should have some positive as well as some negative attributes. \\
Goals & Your character should have a dream, something he or she 
wants to achieve desperately. \\
Phobia & There should be something he or she hates or fears. \\
Distinctiveness & Your character should have a quirk. It should be some distinctive feature, e.g. that could be a tiny voice, a 
special greeting or a preference for yellow hats. 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Please bear in mind that your character starts in Illarion unskilled. He or she cannot be an experienced crafter or warrior from the very beginning\footnote{Especially for players with less experience with roleplaying games, the following archetypes are useful: A servant or maid, recently thrown out of service due to any minor delinquency or a crafter or mercenary in apprenticeship on walk.}.
Give your counterpart a chance for reaction instead of forcing him or her into a situation. Don’t pull her on her sleeve, \emph{try} to pull instead. A good role player will know how wo react properly.

Play in a way that everybody has fun with the game as well.

Don’t force anybody to do something the player behind the character doesn’t want to do. Especially thievery or robberies are difficult to play. It requires at least two persons having 
fun with. 

It is much more difficult to play a villain compared to a normal character. At least you need to 
agree that there finally will be a punishment he or she deserves. 

Don’t let bluff yourself. Behind a grumpy dwarf, bloodthirsty orc or insensible mage is a friend 
you may steal horses with.
